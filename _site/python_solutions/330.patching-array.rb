#
# Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch
# elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be
# formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of
# patches required.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3,
# 4.
# Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3],
# [2,3], [1,2,3].
# Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
# So we only need 1 patch.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
# Output: 0
#
#
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Integer}
