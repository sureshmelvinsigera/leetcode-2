#
# Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given
# tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary
# tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are None.
#
# The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the
# leftmost and right most non-None nodes in the level, where the None nodes
# between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input:
#
# ⁠          1
# ⁠        /   \
# ⁠       3     2
# ⁠      / \     \
# ⁠     5   3     9
#
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4
# (5,3,None,9).
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input:
#
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        /
# ⁠       3
# ⁠      / \
# ⁠     5   3
#
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2
# (5,3).
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input:
#
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        / \
# ⁠       3   2
# ⁠      /
# ⁠     5
#
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2
# (3,2).
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input:
#
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        / \
# ⁠       3   2
# ⁠      /     \
# ⁠     5       9
# ⁠    /         \
# ⁠   6           7
# Output: 8
# Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8
# (6,None,None,None,None,None,None,7).
